##Racket Demos!

With our racket demo program players can try rackets before they
decide which one to buy.  Rackets are the core of your equipment (besides
your own body), and getting one that matches your needs is essential to
playing well, and having fun.

There is a one time fee of $40 at the start of the program, which
allows you to try up to two rackets at a time each week.  The program
lasts for two months, and after all those experiences we will apply
the initial fee to the purchase price of your AWESOME! racket.
